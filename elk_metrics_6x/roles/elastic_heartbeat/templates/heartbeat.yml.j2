#================================ Processors ===================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:
#
#processors:
#- include_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu"]
#- drop_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#- drop_event:
#    when:
#       equals:
#           http.code: 200
#
# The following example renames the field a to b:
#
#processors:
#- rename:
#    fields:
#       - from: "a"
#         to: "b"
#
# The following example tokenizes the string into fields:
#
#processors:
#- dissect:
#    tokenizer: "%{key1} - %{key2}"
#    field: "message"
#    target_prefix: "dissect"
#
# The following example enriches each event with metadata from the cloud
# provider about the host machine. It works on EC2, GCE, DigitalOcean,
# Tencent Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.
#
#processors:
#- add_cloud_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with the machine's local time zone
# offset from UTC.
#
#processors:
#- add_locale:
#    format: offset
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# given fields to an existing container id and adds info from that container:
#
#processors:
#- add_docker_metadata:
#    host: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
#    match_fields: ["system.process.cgroup.id"]
#    match_pids: ["process.pid", "process.ppid"]
#    match_source: true
#    match_source_index: 4
#    match_short_id: false
#    cleanup_timeout: 60
#    labels.dedot: false
#    # To connect to Docker over TLS you must specify a client and CA certificate.
#    #ssl:
#    #  certificate_authority: "/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"
#    #  certificate:           "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
#    #  key:                   "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
# it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
#
#processors:
#- add_docker_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
#
#processors:
#- add_host_metadata:
#   netinfo.enabled: false
#
# The following example enriches each event with process metadata using
# process IDs included in the event.
#
#processors:
#- add_process_metadata:
#    match_pids: ["system.process.ppid"]
#    target: system.process.parent
#
# The following example decodes fields containing JSON strings
# and replaces the strings with valid JSON objects.
#
#processors:
#- decode_json_fields:
#    fields: ["field1", "field2", ...]
#    process_array: false
#    max_depth: 1

  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  #enabled: true

  # The list of Redis servers to connect to. If load balancing is enabled, the
  # events are distributed to the servers in the list. If one server becomes
  # unreachable, the events are distributed to the reachable servers only.
  #hosts: ["localhost:6379"]

  # The Redis port to use if hosts does not contain a port number. The default
  # is 6379.
  #port: 6379

  # The name of the Redis list or channel the events are published to. The
  # default is heartbeat.
  #key: heartbeat

  # The password to authenticate with. The default is no authentication.
  #password:

  # The Redis database number where the events are published. The default is 0.
  #db: 0

  # The Redis data type to use for publishing events. If the data type is list,
  # the Redis RPUSH command is used. If the data type is channel, the Redis
  # PUBLISH command is used. The default value is list.
  #datatype: list

  # The number of workers to use for each host configured to publish events to
  # Redis. Use this setting along with the loadbalance option. For example, if
  # you have 2 hosts and 3 workers, in total 6 workers are started (3 for each
  # host).
  #worker: 1

  # If set to true and multiple hosts or workers are configured, the output
  # plugin load balances published events onto all Redis hosts. If set to false,
  # the output plugin sends all events to only one host (determined at random)
  # and will switch to another host if the currently selected one becomes
  # unreachable. The default value is true.
  #loadbalance: true

  # The Redis connection timeout in seconds. The default is 5 seconds.
  #timeout: 5s

  # The number of times to retry publishing an event after a publishing failure.
  # After the specified number of retries, the events are typically dropped.
  # Some Beats, such as Filebeat, ignore the max_retries setting and retry until
  # all events are published. Set max_retries to a value less than 0 to retry
  # until all events are published. The default is 3.
  #max_retries: 3

  # The maximum number of events to bulk in a single Redis request or pipeline.
  # The default is 2048.
  #bulk_max_size: 2048

  # The URL of the SOCKS5 proxy to use when connecting to the Redis servers. The
  # value must be a URL with a scheme of socks5://.
  #proxy_url:

  # This option determines whether Redis hostnames are resolved locally when
  # using a proxy. The default value is false, which means that name resolution
  # occurs on the proxy server.
  #proxy_use_local_resolver: false

  # Enable SSL support. SSL is automatically enabled, if any SSL setting is set.
  #ssl.enabled: true

  # Configure SSL verification mode. If `none` is configured, all server hosts

  # Certificate for SSL client authentication
  #ssl.certificate: "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"

  # Client Certificate Key

  # Configure cipher suites to be used for SSL connections
  #ssl.cipher_suites: []

  # Configure curve types for ECDHE based cipher suites

    #escape_html: true

  # Path to the directory where to save the generated files. The option is
  # mandatory.
  #path: "/tmp/heartbeat"

  # Name of the generated files. The default is `heartbeat` and it generates
  # files: `heartbeat`, `heartbeat.1`, `heartbeat.2`, etc.
  #filename: heartbeat

  # Maximum size in kilobytes of each file. When this size is reached, and on
  # every heartbeat restart, the files are rotated. The default value is 10240
  # kB.
  #rotate_every_kb: 10000

  # Maximum number of files under path. When this number of files is reached,
  # the oldest file is deleted and the rest are shifted from last to first. The
  # default is 7 files.

#================================= Paths ======================================

# distribution (for example, the sample dashboards).
# If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the
# home path is the location of the binary.
#path.home:

# The configuration path for the heartbeat installation. This is the default
# base path for configuration files, including the main YAML configuration file
# and the Elasticsearch template file. If not set by a CLI flag or in the
# configuration file, the default for the configuration path is the home path.
#path.config: ${path.home}

# The data path for the heartbeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all the files in which heartbeat needs to store its data. If not set by a
# CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the data path is a data
# subdirectory inside the home path.
#path.data: ${path.home}/data

# The logs path for a heartbeat installation. This is the default location for
# the Beat's log files. If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file,
# the default for the logs path is a logs subdirectory inside the home path.

#================================ HTTP Endpoint ======================================
# Each beat can expose internal metrics through a HTTP endpoint. For security
# reasons the endpoint is disabled by default. This feature is currently experimental.
# Stats can be access through http://localhost:5066/stats . For pretty JSON output
# append ?pretty to the URL.

# Defines if the HTTP endpoint is enabled.

# The HTTP endpoint will bind to this hostname or IP address. It is recommended to use only localhost.
