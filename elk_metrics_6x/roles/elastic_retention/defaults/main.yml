### Elastic curator variables
## If any of these retention policy option are undefined a dynamic fact will be
## generated.
## These options are all in days.
#  elastic_logstash_retention: 1
#  elastic_apm_retention: 1
#  elastic_auditbeat_retention: 1
#  elastic_filebeat_retention: 1
#  elastic_heartbeat_retention: 1
#  elastic_journalbeat_retention: 1
#  elastic_metricbeat_retention: 1
#  elastic_packetbeat_retention: 1
#  elastic_skydive_retention: 1

## These options are all in megabytes.
#  elastic_logstash_size: 1024
#  elastic_apm_size: 1024
#  elastic_auditbeat_size: 1024
#  elastic_filebeat_size: 1024
#  elastic_heartbeat_size: 1024
#  elastic_journalbeat_size: 1024
#  elastic_metricbeat_size: 1024
#  elastic_packetbeat_size: 1024
#  elastic_skydive_size: 1024

## WHen a static retention policy option is not defined these options will be
## used for dynamic fact generation.
##
## Facts will be generated for the general retention using the total available
## storage from the ES data nodes, subtracting 25%. Using the weights, each
## index will be given a percentage of the total available storage. Indexes with
## higher weights are expected to use more storage. The list of hosts in a given
## index will be used to determine the number of days data can exist within an
## index before it's pruned.

## Example:
#  es cluster has 4TiB of storage
#  filebeat is deployed to 100 hosts
#  filebeat has a weight of 10
#  metricbeat is deployed to 125 hosts
#  metricbeat has a weight of 2
#
#  es storage in MiB: 4194304
#  hosts and weighting total: (100 + 125) x (10 + 2) = 2700
#  filebeat pct: (100 x 10) / 2700 = 0.37
#  filebeat storage allowed: 0.37 * 4194304 = 1551892.48 MiB
#  filebeat days allowed: 1551892.48 / (100 * 1024) = 15.1552 Days
#  filebeat result: 15 days of retention or 1.5TiB of storage, whatever comes first
#  metricbeat pct: (125 x 2) / 2700 = 0.09
#  metricbeat storage allowed: 0.09 * 4194304 = 377487.36 MiB
#  metricbeat days allowed: 377487.36 / (125 * 1024) = 2.94912 Days
#  metricbeat result: 2 days of retention or 38GiB of storage, whatever comes first
