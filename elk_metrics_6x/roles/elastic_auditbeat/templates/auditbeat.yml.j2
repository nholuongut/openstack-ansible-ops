########################## Auditbeat Configuration #############################

# This is a reference configuration file documenting all non-deprecated options
# in comments. For a shorter configuration example that contains only the most
# common options, please see auditbeat.yml in the same directory.

#============================  Config Reloading ================================

# Config reloading allows to dynamically load modules. Each file which is
# monitored must contain one or multiple modules as a list.

  # Period on which files under path should be checked for changes
  reload.period: 60s

  # Set to true to enable config reloading
  reload.enabled: true

# Maximum amount of time to randomly delay the start of a metricset. Use 0 to
# disable startup delay.

#================================ Processors ===================================

# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:
#
#processors:
#- include_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu"]
#- drop_fields:
#    fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#- drop_event:
#    when:
#       equals:
#           http.code: 200
#
# The following example renames the field a to b:
#
#processors:
#- rename:
#    fields:
#       - from: "a"
#         to: "b"
#
# The following example tokenizes the string into fields:
#
#processors:
#- dissect:
#    tokenizer: "%{key1} - %{key2}"
#    field: "message"
#    target_prefix: "dissect"
#
# The following example enriches each event with metadata from the cloud
# provider about the host machine. It works on EC2, GCE, DigitalOcean,
# Tencent Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.
#
#processors:
#- add_cloud_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with the machine's local time zone
# offset from UTC.
#
#processors:
#- add_locale:
#    format: offset
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# given fields to an existing container id and adds info from that container:
#
#processors:
#- add_docker_metadata:
#    host: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
#    match_fields: ["system.process.cgroup.id"]
#    match_pids: ["process.pid", "process.ppid"]
#    match_source: true
#    match_source_index: 4
#    match_short_id: false
#    cleanup_timeout: 60
#    labels.dedot: false
#    # To connect to Docker over TLS you must specify a client and CA certificate.
#    #ssl:
#    #  certificate_authority: "/etc/pki/root/ca.pem"
#    #  certificate:           "/etc/pki/client/cert.pem"
#    #  key:                   "/etc/pki/client/cert.key"
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
# it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
#
#processors:
#- add_docker_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
#
#processors:
#- add_host_metadata:
#   netinfo.enabled: false
#
# The following example enriches each event with process metadata using
# process IDs included in the event.
#
#processors:
#- add_process_metadata:
#    match_pids: ["system.process.ppid"]
#    target: system.process.parent
#
# The following example decodes fields containing JSON strings
# and replaces the strings with valid JSON objects.
#
#processors:
#- decode_json_fields:
#    fields: ["field1", "field2", ...]
#    process_array: false
#    max_depth: 1

# home path is the location of the binary.

# and the Elasticsearch template file. If not set by a CLI flag or in the
# configuration file, the default for the configuration path is the home path.
#path.config: ${path.home}

# The data path for the auditbeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all the files in which auditbeat needs to store its data. If not set by a
# CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the data path is a data
# subdirectory inside the home path.
#path.data: ${path.home}/data

# The logs path for a auditbeat installation. This is the default location for
